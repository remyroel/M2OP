- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 2 concepts used:
  This is a Pokemon game. At the start of the game the user gets to chose which Pokemon to use.
  Three Pokemon - Three Types: Fire, Water, Grass (each a child of the parent pokemon class)
  The opponents pokemon will be assigned randomly from three possibilities.
  Once the battle begins the user chooses between a Basic Attack and a Power Attack.
  Basic Attack does 10 damage, Power Attack does 15 damage, the Pokemon types have different attack names.
  The Pokemon all start at 50 Health, they will battle until one of the Pokemon has no health left.
  This is a inheritance class relationship project. 
- Future work (how you could expand the program with more time):
  I want the user to have multiple pokemon that they can chose from based on who they are fighting against.
  I want to certain attacks to do more or less damage based on the type of pokemon. This way, users can 
  switch out the pokemon if it isn't useful. 
- I think I earned 60 points:
Main program complexity/usability: 40/40 (used OOP, interactive w user, input validation, and easily readable)
Testing: 10/20 (all tests are passed, but could be more robust)
Is-A/Has-A class relationship: 20/20 (no errors, the three types all contain individuality)
File input: 0/10 (missing)
